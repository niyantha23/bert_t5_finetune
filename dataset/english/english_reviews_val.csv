5068,en_0871983,product_en_0814870,reviewer_en_0045493,"Literally just got this an hour ago. Bought it because my friend needs a headset and honestly so do I. I didnt wamt to pay for two high priced headsets so I took a look at cheap ones. Main thing I liked about this is the splitter jack. Years ago I had bought myself some headphones made by afterglow that came with a audio splitter. It was my favorite headset. Not only could you hear the gameplay and voice chat but you could also hear the music you played from your phone or other device. I got this in hopes of finding a cheap headset me and my friend could both have and also because I wanted that same audio splitter. Yes I could have bought a pricey headset with a splitter but like I said. I was shopping for a friend too so I didnt want to spend a whole lot. The reviews on this were good so I said lets do it. The product got to my door and I was excited. I unboxed the headset, read the instructions and configuration booklet and plugged it in. First thing I noticed. A sharp screeching noise when you try to turn up or down on the volume control. I had to set it to mid volume in order to not hear screeching but the gameplay audio was very low and there was a little bit of static in the background. I started a party chat to test if my whole party could hear the audio through my headset( have to check because cheap headset have an issue with your friends being able to hear what you are playing even when your tv volume is turned all the way down) and nothing. So I thought alright cool lets try talking. I spoke and no audio was transmitted to my party. I ended up having to twist and push in the headsets jack in order to use the mic ( yes I had it plugged in correctly) and when I spoke I could hear myself as well. That was with just the headsets jack in. The splitter does not work at all. Well not completely. The screeching issue when adjusting the volume was gone but all you can hear is the music you plugged in. Nothing else. You cant even talk to your friends anymore because the microphone is just simply unfixable no matter what you do.

I asked for a pair of these for Christmas a couple years ago. I have always had trouble with earbuds staying in my ears, so I thought I'd give these a try after reading the reviews. When I got them, I was pleasantly surprised with how easily and comfortably they fit. Then I plugged them in. I was immediately impressed with the sound quality. I used them all the time, working out at the gym, on long plane rides, and just sitting around and relaxing. Through some normal wear and tear, the wires split and stripped a little. Once that happened, the sound cut in and out. Since I loved these earbuds so much, I decided to buy another pair. They just arrived an hour ago. I am extremely disappointed, to say the least. The first thing I noticed out of the box is that the main wire is thinner, and much more flimsy feeling, than it used to be. Though, it is about a half inch longer. My first thought was wondering how long it would take for this pair to split with such flimsy design. Then I plugged it into my phone, which is where I listen to most of my music. I could immediately hear a downgrade in sound, which was so disappointing to me. I took my old pair and plugged them in just to make sure I wasn't imagining it. The old ones still sounded great!! My first experience with these earbuds was so amazing. That's why I had no problem spending $75 to get another pair. If I had known I'd be getting an inferior product, I never would have added these to my shopping cart. Poor sound, poor design. I have added a couple pictures. In one of the pictures, you can see my old pair with 3 splits and exposed wire. In the other, you can see the comparison to the new and old. Though I'm not sure how well you can tell the difference in thickness of the wire.","**DO NOT BUY** This product used to be excellent, but not anymore.

The one we bought has been in use for exactly one year. You can see from the pictures that it is now falling apart. The fabric mesh has several small rips and is coming away from the seem in places. Two of the thin metal bands that hold the structure of this hamper have come loose. One of them is a loop and the other has a sharp terminal! The one that is a loop used to be very small. It stuck out just a little. Because the band is so thin in profile, it was invisible against the dark blue hamper full of dark clothes. It caught my toe as I walked by and ouch! It sawed between my toes as it pulled out from the fabric. I spilled my morning coffee all over the bathroom. We probably should have replaced this hamper months ago but I was being stubborn.

This device violates rule #2. It isn't nearly rigid enough. I wanted to look above my ceiling to trace the electrical wiring, but I couldn't snake this thing more than about four feet before it started to bend and bunch up. Trying to negotiate it through any sort of rough terrain is maddening when you can't see well and you have no control over the tip. All you can do is push on that rope. Why have a 10 meter scope if you can't use more than four feet of it? You might be able to run it down some kind of conduit or pipe or reinforce the cable with wire to stiffen it, but I don't feel like that should be necessary. 2) Thinking maybe I was using this for the wrong purpose, I tried running it down a drain pipe. I couldn't negotiate the P trap and the camera got covered with gunk so quickly that it wouldn't have mattered if I could. I think the best use for this is to look under your refrigerator or maybe in your gutter downspout. 3) The camera needs some kind of self-leveling mechanism. It's impossible to keep the cable from rotating as you try to maneuver it. You can tell the app to rotate the image 90 degrees at a time, but you can't tell the scope to stay right side up. You're constantly trying to figure out which way is up and what you're looking at. 4) When you add attachments, they block the view of the camera. It's like walking around using only your peripheral vision. It works, but not well. With much effort I successfully retrieved my keys using the magnet and the hook when they were on the floor right in front of me, so there's some theoretical value there. The mirror attachment is simply unusable -- I already said it was hard to use, once you can't see what's in front of you it's impossible. 5) The ""magic claw"" isn't attached to the device at all. It's a completely separate tool, and not very good. Search Amazon for ""flexible grabber"" and you'll see what it is, except it's only 2 feet long including the handle. Worthless. 6) You have to disconnect from your normal WiFi network in order to connect to this device. Not a deal killer, but inconvenient.

Certainly they can be used in a wired mode, but that has become less and less convenient. The product fits well and is unobtrusive. It sounds fine. It can be charged without removing it and this is its biggest selling point over competitors. In the material, it says ""Built-in long lasting battery, charging 2 hours for enjoying up to 15 hrs music playtime or talk."" so I thought the battery would be fine. It actually only lasts between 3 and 4 hours. I contacted the seller and they responded: ""Hello, Thanks for your message, this adapter's battery life is about 5 hours, so it is normal to be that.

I purchased this pillow because I am a back sleeper and I wanted a slight incline and cervical support. I opened package let it completely expand. I then laid down for 15 minutes to see if it would work for me. Short answer is NOPE. It claims to be a very supportive memory foam wedge with support for your neck. They do not say that you need to have a specific length of neck for this pillow to be comfortable. I do not have a long neck, however it isn't that short. This pillow did not give the correct alignment for my cervical vertebra to be curved properly. Also the supportive part ends at almost a standard pillow size and then there is a soft floppy pad of light weight and very soft 1"" memory foam. That accounts for half the pillows length. After 5-10 minutes my lower back started to spasm. I will give benefit of the doubt here and add a disclaimer that maybe I happened to get a defective pillow.

The material is durable and the lips around the edges allow them to collect dirt and debris. The only flaw I found was the texture on the trunk mat. I was hoping for something that had a little more friction. As is, my groceries slide all over the place on the slick surface. This would be a good thing if you have something heavy, say a big tent, cooler full of ice and drinks, and large luggage that you want to set on the edge and slide to the back of the vehicle. In that case, you don't want sticky friction making it more difficult. That is a rare case for me, as I am more likely to throw a cart full of groceries back there. That type of texture would have made it difficult to clean too, which I can appreciate. I like the texture on the rest of the floor mats where it makes sense. It is enough of a problem for me that I removed a star. I also removed a star because they are extremely expensive! I would have liked to see them more around $150 - $175. But I still bought them, and I do HOPE they last for the life of the vehicle, in which case, it is a worthy investment. If I have to replace them in 5 years, the cost would then be unreasonable. Overall, I highly recommend these floor mats to anyone looking to protect their 2016 RAV4 floors. They are very expensive and things in the trunk do slide around too much, but you won't find a better fit or better protection I think. 3/5 stars.

I'd have rather paid a little more to get a couple minor improvements and then the difference between these and $180 bibs would have been far less and this would be a 5 star review. So where's the area for improvements: 1) In this price range a gel chamois is expected or at least something approximating that sort of density. Sadly I didn't see that in the description it says ""foam"" padding. That's just lame. It really doesn't do much of anything padding wise. 2) While I'm sure it helps from a coolness factor, the bib straps are just too flimsy a material. It isn't the same as the rest of the shorts so it really doesn't pull the shorts up and keep them in position. Better than a drawstring at the waist but just not as functional as a bib should be.

One thing that's great is that it holds a lot of cards without bending them as long as you don't try to move the book around in weird ways and what not. But that's about all this does. The book itself just looks like they took 2 x 20 page monster binders and then slapped them together into one binding, so overall its not really great for people who like to admire their cards frequently.

7660,en_0542338,product_en_0019610,reviewer_en_0261374,"This movie is good. It is not great, but it covers a lot of bases. The directing is excellent, with camera work and scene structure that builds to a worthy end. The acting is great, with Renee Russo and Jake Gyllenhaal remaining captivating throughout. Gyllenhaal's character deeply flawed protagonist is excellent as it delicately balances multiple deep character flaws that leave you uncertain and curious to know what happens next. But the story is... unsatisfying. Anticlimactic. Poor. And far worse. Without spoilers I will do the best I can. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays a character who has no character arc, that is not the point of this movie. He starts off desperate and hungry for success, and he ends the same way. We only see the slightest suggestions of him becoming more successful, and we see how far he will go for that success - but this is not new, as we see him go just as far in the opening minutes of the film. Though I imagine everyone is expecting the movie and plot to go in a certain direction (because it is an absurdly cliche story that you have seen before in TV shows, other movies, and books), the movie ends up aiming slightly lower to avoid being entirely cliche. I am certain that at some point the writer/director realized that this was just another retelling of an old trope, and tried to edit the ending to make it a tad less obvious. It does not benefit the movie. Taking a trope and making it weaker does not make a strong movie, it makes a forgettable movie. That is what this movie is - incredibly forgettable. But that is not all that is wrong with the writing in this film. Gyllenhaal's character is clearly autistic (and the writer/director has confirmed this is intentional) to the point that this comes off as a hit piece about people with autism. I have worked with people on the spectrum and while Gyllenhaal's portrayal of an autistic protagonist is well done, the writing behind it disastrously misunderstands what autism is. While the writing has Gyllenhaal correctly neglecting enormous social cues, it also portrays him as obscenely manipulative, exercising such enormous control over social situations that it is absurd. To be frank, regardless of how high functioning Jake Gyllenhaal's character is supposed to be, he cannot both be autistic and simultaneously be so ridiculously successfully manipulative in social situations. This movie makes autistic people out to be self centered villains who will stop at absolutely nothing to obtain what they want. It is a disgustingly misinformed examination of autism. At this point you may be wondering why this movie has such high reviews. While it may be due to Jake Gyllenhaal's convincing glass eyed smiles or Renee Russo's believable portrayal of a struggling exec, I think it also has to do with a less impressive aspect of the film. This movie aims for low hanging fruit, criticizing the news media for being exploitative and corrupt. Literally all of America (and much of the world) has an issue with this right now, the only difference from person to person being exactly which stations they think are worse. I am not saying the media does not deserve this criticism (it really does), and the movie does an excellent job at portraying how ratings come before morality - I am just saying that this is the modern equivalent of making an 80's scifi movie where the military and government are the villains. But that is it. A huge cliche aimed at an easy target. A disgustingly inaccurate portrayal of a person with autism. A well directed movie with a very low goal that completely succeeds at what it is trying to do, but will be forgotten by the next day.","A movie that does many things right, but is not worth watching.",en,digital_video_download,neutral

Basically, you need to let one of these earphones (doesn't matter which one) pair to the other BEFORE pairing either with device. If you pair with your device first, both of them will show up and you end up having an either/or situation instead of both. So once they're paired with each other, only pair ONE of your earbuds to the phone and VOILA, you have music in both ears!

I ordered another 2 the next day but this time one of them came a bit short of the quality I was expecting. I am aware no 2 lamps are alike and there will be irregularities in the form but this one had gray dark streaks that looked like mold around it and the light was concentrated only on the base of the lamp and the top third half just looked like a pink salt block, I am returning one of them. I guess 3 out of 4 is not bad, hence the 4 stars. Update: As soon as my review posted on Amazon Levoit contacted me directly, refunded my money and told me I didn’t need to go through the hassle of sending the defective salt lamp, truly impressive customer service.

There's just something about it that makes it so hard to put air into. There was only ONE time out of the 3 that I was actually able to put air into it and it was awesome!!! Other than that, it was not. It was too much work to put air into that I had to make it some kind of a game. I mean, there's just too big of a hole to close off when air is being put into the hammock. I can't say it can hold 440 pounds either. I think it was more like 200 pounds at the most. Any more than that, it will start to flatten. When it was inflated perfectly, many of us were able to hang on the sides and float around. Two of us were able to lay on it without drowning. The mesh actually stayed in one piece too. No rip whatsoever. The fastening of the buckle doesn't make sense to me, but if it works then that is all that matters. I just need to get used to the buckling, I guess. I gave this hammock 4 stars because the idea of a hammock that requires swinging around in a circle to put air into it is cool to me. When it is inflated, it is fun. When it is deflated, it is space saving. And when it is being used, it becomes a fun water activity. Just be careful with it though. The nylon and mesh feels thin, but it can still last a while if taken care of correctly and carefully. Thank you!",Ahhh!,en,toy,positive

I tried to instantly crimp the portion of the blind that was damaged and it didn't change it. It still looked damaged and bent. I was beginning to think 'what a waste of money.' I went away for a few minutes about to call Home Depot to see if they simply had new blinds in stock. Then I stopped myself and thought I'd better give it at least one last try. This time I held the damaged part in the device at a curve and held it for about 30-40 seconds. When I released it it had made it significantly better this time. Then I did kind of the same thing in three little areas on the same damaged part again to try and clean it up a bit more. I would say that made it better by another 20%. I think the key here is you have to hold the damaged part curved in the device for at least 40 seconds, maybe even pushing your thumb along it, and then kind of focus more on the nuanced parts of the same damage portion to try and clean it up after the first attempt. I would say if you are a patient person and are willing to treat the process as a kind of microscopic surgery to an extent as opposed to a job you can complete instantly then I think you'll appreciate this device. If the blinds are still hanging it's basically a situation of pulling up a chair for a good half hour and getting to work like a craftsman on them. Maybe you can speed up the process as you get good at it but just prepare yourself to treat it as if you were about to carve a small wood sculpture. It is rewarding though once you see them sort of come back to life. To add, this really works best on blinds that have been bent simply at a 90 degree angle rather than those that are actually mangled and bumpy. Like I said with the bumps it really takes a bit of work and nuanced focus to get those looking decent again.",Most honest review (I believe),en,other,positive

LIKES: 1) fits well in my ear and doesn't fall out. Set it and forget it. It only has one button, and if it is set correctly I have no trouble accessing the button (to end or answer a call). 2) Battery seems to last a long time... put it this way...I have not had the battery die on me yet after numerous calls during a day. 3) The charging method is clever. . . just plug in the USB base, and the earbud has a magnet that grabs it out of your hand for a perfect connection every time. You can find in it dark easily! 4) The speaker is very clear and un-distorted....I'd say the best I've ever had. 5) It has a seemingly long range... longer than others I've had. DISLIKES: 1) I do not like the voice. Why not use the old AT&T woman's voice? This woman speaks the commands clearly, but I just don't like it. Sounds like an old girlfriend. 2) When you walk too far from your phone, it doesn't warn you. . . it just disconnects. You have to turn it back on to reconnect. 3) If you don't use it for awhile, it will turn itself off. I guess that is a good thing? I just have never turned them off until I'm done for the day. 4) Occasionally, and always when you are trying to connect a call..... it will just not work correctly.

They had your typical tongue-and-groove design, making it impossible to paint an even coat without it looking all globby. While I found out the paint I was using was also infuriating other customers (Valspar High Gloss Enamel SUCKS, is NOT ""self-leveling"" or ""easy to clean,"" and chips with the scrape of a thumbnail despite surface prep!) Overall, you have to clean this device quickly in between uses, but for this price point you can seriously knock some extra work and time off of a project that may take days to do the old-fashioned way. It was worth it to me! I will definitely be using it long into the future. Checkout a breakdown of various components below: Anyway, this product was fairly easy to use after perusing the instructions for a bit. While the viscosity cup provided is supposed to help indicate how much to thin your paint, it didn't really work for its intended purpose, as my paint was taking FOREVER to go through the funnel, way beyond any of the indicated times on the instructions. (For example, instructions indicate to add certain amount of water or thinner based on amount of time it takes for the paint to run through the funnel filled to the top). This led to some difficulty in figuring out how much I should dilute my paint, which led to some trial and error. However, most paint cans do have instructions for paint sprayer dilution, so that helped some! >APPLICATION - relatively easy but takes a bit of practice and increasing the velocity of the spray to ensure it is coming out in an even stream and not in splatters, which can also be affected a lot by how much you diluted it. Won't flow correctly if it is too thick. Difficult to do small applications of paint because you have to keep scraping the paint to the bottom of the container for it to be sucked through the straw. >DEVICE ITSELF - turns on easily, but I will say it the motor starts getting pretty hot quickly, which made me a bit nervous to use it for more than a few minutes at a time. Parts are all easy to assemble/reassemble. >CLEANING - While the parts are easy to clean, I frequently wished that I could put it down and come back to it later in between coats. Paint can be left in the reservoir if you seal it well with plastic wrap, but you have to run water through the sprayer otherwise it will get all dried up VERY fast with water-based paint once you turn it off. You 100% NEED a straw-cleaning bristle brush to clean the sprayer channels that don't detach from the device if anything dries up, otherwise globby and half-dried paint starts going through the nozzle and screwing up the spray pattern.","Good, and easy enough to use for the price!",en,home_improvement,positive

However, the combination of how/where the hose exits the canister, and the size and number of wheels on the bottom, lead to a continual nuisance of tipping over. The plastic lever for switching out attachments is very cheap plastic, and broke as I was unpacking the vacuum. This may be a huge issue for some, but I don’t ever use attachments, so for me, no harm, no foul. The location of the power switch is a bit problematic as well, considering the other switch located in the mirror position on the back of the canister, causes the cord to retract. I’ve done this no less than 500 times. And no, for clarity, I am not a slow learner. That said, I do in fact, love that the vacuum has a retractable cord. I realize it is trivial, but for me, the winding and wrapping of a loose cord is just irritating. Not difficult, irritating.

I have tried over 15 different brands on Amazon over the past few years and so far this SONY brand has shown the most reliability of any other brands I have tried. Other brands have been cheaper but they also die at an alarming rate thus making the cost go up greatly as I constantly have to replace them with new batteries. I get approximately 5-7 days of use from these batteries as opposed to other brands which vary from 1-3 days with a rapid discharge rate that takes just a few hours to go from a correct level of light to dead in hours. Save your money and time hunting and try these SONY CR2032 batteries. I will keep looking for a LONGER LASTING battery but for now these are the ones I will use until something better comes around.

Of course the owner also called it off, so not really a good test, but dog did look a little perturbed when it was noisily sparking. Taught me a lesson: If dogs in area have it 'ON' and in the hand while walking. In the pocket and turned off cost me time, because I was fumbling to get it out. That dog came quick.

I had a damaged ankle when I started trying out for professional soccer teams and I was wearing one of these the entire time. I ended up getting picked up and was able to play in Sweden. This brace went above and beyond to protect my ankle so I could achieve my dream. My ankle did end up blowing out when I kicked the ball at the same time as another player that came from the side of me, but it was a ticking time bomb anyway and nothing in the world would have prevented that. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because it seems like the velcro has changed. Back when I got my first one, the velcro stuck very strong and it would never come loose.

There was nothing holding the individual pieces in place, but at least the balls were all screwed on. Luckily, there was no scratches on the material. Putting them in: difficult. One of the balls was stuck on and I couldn’t get it to budge at first. I almost considered returning one set but I was able to get t off after about 10 minutes of trying. Putting them in was challenging because I can’t see behind my ear of course. I’ve been wearing them for a couple weeks now, and I am still pleased.

Unlike some other earbuds I’ve tried, these don’t skip at all. I’ve had no issues with the battery life... I’ve never had them run out while I’m using them. Sound quality... not great. The bass response is poor. It’s slightly better if you can keep the buds firmly inserted in your ear canal, but they seem to work their way out of the ear. They don’t fall off, but they back out. I think this is partially due to the small rubber tab that helps retain them to the outer ear.

I am not sure who the target reader is for this book, as there are many who could find something worthwhile in it, but it makes sense that it is in the Contemporary fiction genre. It is true to life and very realistic. The character of Swain becomes more likable as the story moves on. With each chapter, the drama of Swain's recent life, the divorce, and the loss of his daughter all unfold. I felt for him in his losses and in his joys that he feared to embrace for so long. The Jones character seems to simply exist as a foil to Swain's character; he is the jerk of a friend that one just can't let go of. The details of living in Hong Kong and the ups and downs of living on a boat were pretty interesting.

I do not have a Macbook so I tried it with two different sized computers and they both fit so there is plenty of room. The zipper opens on three sides which allows the case to open completely and lay flat on the table. The inside is cushioned and provides protection for the device. I do love the color though it looks closer to royal than navy blue. One downside for me is that there is no handle or strap with which to carry the case. The case would easily fit inside a backpack or briefcase but would be a bit more cumbersome to carry alone. In addition, the case is a fairly slick material so it can slip out of your hand while carrying. It is waterproof (I tested it by putting a sheet of paper inside and holding it out in the rain; the paper remained dry) and has a roomy zippered pocket on the outside for carrying a mouse or ear buds or other items.

The size capacity also appears to be very generous - I am easily able to fit a towel as well as other beach items inside without issue. The waterproof compartment at the bottom is excellent, and easily fits my US > 10 size shoes. I'm sure it would make a great use for packing a lunch or picnic items. The zipper straps are also very colorful and of a well-suited color scheme. If I were to lose this bag I would definitely choose to purchase it again, as it has performed its duty well thus far.

I have it attached to a 50' stainless steel hose that runs down the backside of the house with the other end of the hose attached directly to a side faucet. Makes for turning water on and off easy.

9994,en_0509381,product_en_0657550,reviewer_en_0994332,"Firstly, I'm not your average joe when it comes to a car wash. This is the best product I have ever used on my Corvette. I've had corvettes for 6 years now and no product has done to my car what this has. My car is SLIPPERY!!! SMOOTH!!!! LIKE NEVER BEFORE ITS AMAZING! I want to say SLIPPERY again because that's what it does! Do these steps. If your car is stupidly dirty and has been for a long time ***clay bar first*** 1. Start off by wax stripping your car with Meguiars wash+ as a normal car wash expect bucket only method . Do sections at a time (do not let that stuff dry on your car). Water it down and do sections at a time. Please understand that. 2. Use this sealant on your car. Easy on the entire car then buff off after it turns white. Read product directions. You can do it a second time (not necessary) but wait 30 minutes after you buffed first coat. Please wait 6 hours before adding anything else after this. 3. After 6 hours of curing the sealant on paint, use *Car Guys Hybrid Wax Spray*. I bought a gallon, well worth it. Spray your entire car with that while buffing off doing sections at a time. You can do 2 coats for a better result. This stuff will last you months!!! Sealant is once or twice a year. Hybrid spray wax is applied after every car wash. ***Make sure when you wash your car next time to not use wax stripper on it or you'll defeat everything you have done. The wax stripper is a tool used to prep for a new sealant or wax on the car*** Did you read that up there? 4. Also I like to use chemical guys maxi suds grape. Its concentrated and a gallon. Its $18. Buy 2 gallons it will last you 3 years! Use it right, do not exaggerate. *A cap can do 5 gallons of water* Use more If you want. Best car wash shampoo you'll ever use, better then their entire line up as well. 1 galling should last you a year or 2 depending on how you use it and how much. This product is a shampoo that leaves a small amount of wax and a coat of enhanced glossier on your car after every wash. Never wash your car with hard water after you put this stuff on your car or you'll just strip it of your cars surface. *************************************** Do all of this on your car and maintain it that way all the time. You will wish you can thank me. This is the perfect stuff to keep your car looking its vest you wont even want to drive it! Thanks Car Guys, you guys are something else. This product is really a 10/5 stars",Read this now instead of all the reviews!,en,automotive,positive
